== Hello World example

Some bullet-points regarding it:

* main function is always executed code when started the program
* println is obvious. 
* rs file ending is not necessary, but usual

All logic in hello.rs:
[,rust]
----
include::hello.rs[]
----

While compilation to files are dropping out.

* the executable - hello.exe
* https://docs.rs/pdb/latest/pdb/[debugging information] - hello.pdb

Compilation is done with `rustc hello.rs` or `rustc hello-rs -o world`. Always compiled for the base system. So 

[source, bash]
----
$ .\hello.exe  
Hello world!
----

== rusfmt

Corrects formatting of the file like spaces, empty lines and Co. to the default.

[source, bash]
----
$ rustfmt hello.rs
----
